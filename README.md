# <ins>Automatic Irrigation System</ins>

### **POC Description**

-----
Building an Irrigation System with the following tasks
- **Create Plot Of land.**
- **Configure a plot of land.**
- **Edit a plot of land.**
- **List all plots and it's details.**
- **Integration interface with the sensor device once a plot of land
  need to be irrigated.**
- **Update the status of the slot once the request is successfully sent
  to the sensor device.**
- **Retry calls to the sensor device in case the sensor not available
  (pre-configured.**
- **Alerting system to be implemented in case the sensor not
  available and after exceeding the retry times using Twilio.**

## Mocking Server As Sensor Integration
- A Simple server contains one API to integrate with the irrigation system
- It should be started before running the irrigation system
- go to the current directory containing **sensor-system.jar** file and try with this command
 `java -jar sensor-system.jar`
- you should have a database on your machine with the name **irrigation_system**
- this service requires a database user with **postgres** as a username and **12345** as a password so you need to create a user with these credentials.
- The sensor-system.jar is responsible for changing the status of plots and updating irrigation time slot to the current.
